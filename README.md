# soft3d
Made by following this [tutorial] (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/davrous/archive/2013/06/13/tutorial-series-learning-how-to-write-a-3d-soft-engine-from-scratch-in-c-typescript-or-javascript.aspx)

All made in Python with fucking ugly code and TkInter Canvas as the frontbuffer. Matrix operations handled by numpy. Pillow handles the pixelBuffer->TkInter image cuz i don't know how lol.
Runs no better than a quadraplegic on ice.
